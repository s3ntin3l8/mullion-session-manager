// Issue #820 (round 4, tray-repo prerequisites) — a minimal, dependency-free
// port of src/services/ssh-agent-filter.ts's sign-only classifier for the
// `mullion helper` CLI. Deliberately NOT imported from src/services/: same
// reasoning as ssh-agent-bridge-mux.mjs's own header comment — this file
// runs standalone on a laptop with no Mullion checkout at all, bundled
// directly into the Node SEA (scripts/build-helper-sea.mjs), and the
// `.mjs` CLI tree is zero-dependency, `node:` builtins only, no build step.
// Both sides of this classifier are deliberately maintained as two separate
// implementations; a change to SSH_AGENT_REQUEST_TYPE_VECTORS in
// ssh-agent-filter.ts must be mirrored here by hand — grep this repo for
// "ssh-agent-filter.ts" if you're touching one and forget the other exists.
//
// Unlike ssh-agent-bridge-mux.mjs (a hand-mirrored PORT with no shared
// source of truth beyond code review), this twin's own test suite
// (test/cli/ssh-agent-filter.test.ts) additionally validates against
// test/fixtures/ssh-agent-filter-vectors.json — the machine-readable
// fixture round 4 PR1 generates FROM ssh-agent-filter.ts's own table. Both
// implementations are provably checked against that one shared source, not
// just against each other by hand, closing (for this module) the exact
// drift risk the mux twin's own comment warns about.
//
// This module is now the AUTHORITATIVE enforcement point the TypeScript
// module's own header comment has described since issue #820's original
// design: a compromised or malicious primary (or a bug anywhere in the
// mux/routes wiring between it and the laptop) must not be able to mutate
// the laptop's SSH agent — only ask it to list identities or produce a
// signature. src/services/ssh-agent-filter.ts's own instance
// (ssh-agent-relay.ts) is defense in depth on the primary-side leg, not the
// primary enforcement boundary — see that module's own comment.
//
// This module only ever classifies REQUESTS (the client->agent direction,
// SSH_AGENTC_* below) — the real agent's own REPLIES (SSH_AGENT_* success/
// failure/identity-answer/sign-response) are always relayed unfiltered in
// the other direction. They originate from something already trusted (the
// real local agent, only ever replying to a request this filter already
// let through), so there is nothing for a reply-direction filter to guard
// against.
//
// Wire format (draft-miller-ssh-agent, the protocol OpenSSH/1Password/every
// real ssh-agent speaks): each message is a 4-byte big-endian length prefix
// followed by that many bytes of body, whose first byte is the message
// type. Framing here deliberately mirrors ssh-agent-bridge-mux.mjs's own
// decodeFrame — fixed-width header, fail-closed on anything malformed —
// but is a distinct length-prefixed format (SSH agent protocol's own), not
// this repo's mux frame format; the two must not be conflated.
