// Issue #820 (round 4 PR2) — composes ssh-agent-bridge-mux.mjs's channel
// piping primitives with ssh-agent-filter.mjs's sign-only classifier into
// the ONE relay `mullion helper run` needs: requests flowing FROM the
// primary (mux channel) TOWARD the real local agent (net.Socket) are
// filtered; replies flowing back are relayed unmodified. Direct structural
// mirror of src/services/ssh-agent-relay.ts, which composes
// src/services/ssh-agent-filter.ts the same way for the primary-side leg —
// see that module's own header comment. THIS module is the authoritative
// enforcement point (ssh-agent-filter.mjs's own header comment); the
// primary-side one is defense in depth.
//
// `socket` is the laptop's real local agent connection
// (`net.connect({path: sshAuthSock})` in ssh-agent-helper.mjs's runRun).
// `channel` is the mux channel toward the bridge/primary. Both must
// already be open/accepted.
