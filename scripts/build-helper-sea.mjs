// Round 3 (PR2) — builds `mullion-helper[.exe]`, a Node Single Executable
// Application (https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html)
// bundling src/cli/helper-main.mjs so a laptop can run `mullion helper
// pair|run|install|uninstall` with no Node install of its own. `npm run
// build:helper-sea`; CI wires this into `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`
// (a `windows-latest` job, gated on `release_created`, mirroring
// `build-tarball`'s own shape — release ARTIFACTS are Windows-only for now,
// see that job's own comment) and into `ci-cd.yml` (`test-windows` +
// round 4's `test-macos`, both building and probing the SAME bundle on
// every PR — see each job's own comment for what it verifies).
//
// Node SEA is still explicitly experimental upstream, and `postject`
// (https://www.npmjs.com/package/postject) is still `1.0.0-alpha.6` as of
// this PR — both are the currently-recommended tools for this regardless,
// there's no stable alternative.
//
// Bundled to CJS, not ESM, even though Node 26's `--experimental-sea-config`
// itself accepts `"mainFormat": "module"`. Deliberately NOT that: with an
// ESM main, `import.meta.url` inside the bundle resolves to
// `pathToFileURL(process.execPath)` — a PLAUSIBLE-LOOKING but wrong value,
// since nothing inside a SEA has "a directory it lives in" the way a real
// file does — so a future accidental `import.meta` reference would silently
// resolve to a bogus path instead of failing anywhere. CJS output makes
// `import.meta` empty instead, and `--log-override:empty-import-meta=error`
// (below) promotes that to a hard BUILD failure — this is exactly the
// mechanism that caught src/cli/ssh-agent-helper-install.mjs's own
// `defaultScriptPath()` during development (see
// src/cli/ssh-agent-helper-default-script-path.mjs's header comment for how
// that one specific `import.meta.url` use is kept out of this bundle
// entirely, rather than merely gated at runtime).
